# Chessnlyzer - Local webapp to analyze my games
This app is to learn how  
- to build an web-application with flask, 
- to use the lichess.org api and 
- to analyze my chess games.

## Programming Tools
To create this app I have used:
- Python, HTML, CSS
- Flask
- lichess.org-API-Client Berserk
- Jupyter Lab
- Fedora Linux (arm64)

After attending the MLH Global Hack Week: API I wanted to explore the lichess.org API to do stuff with my chess game data. I decided to create an webapp to be able to display graphs and other analytical results.
I also decided that I want to use a python framework, because I did not feel confident enough to use Java Script.
After testing Django and Flask I went with Flask, for it to be the lighter framework. I had the feeling getting-started-part felt easier.
